    <h1>Lorenz Noe</h1>
    
    <p>Hi, I'm a research manager and data analyst focused on development finance and statistical capacity building, with a special interest in climate and energy data. I work at the intersection of data and policy, helping decision-makers turn noise into signal and enable better allocation of scarce resources.</p>
    
    <p>Currently, I lead research activities at Open Data Watch, where I manage projects on development data financing, gender statistics, and climate data. My work involves quantitative analysis of development finance flows and other datasets, building data platforms that make critical information accessible, and providing technical assistance to National Statistical Offices.</p>
    
    <p>I hold an MPP from Georgetown University and combine skills in R, Stata, and Python with strong foundations in statistical methodologies to address complex data questions.</p>
    
    <p>I'm interested in connecting with others using data to tackle policy challenges in development, climate, energy, and economics.</p>
